This exercise is from Cay Horstmann, Big Java Early Objects, 6th edition, page 123 

Implement a class Product. A product has a name and a price, for example new
Product("Toaster", 29.95). Supply methods getName, getPrice, and reducePrice. Supply
a program ProductPrinter that makes two products, prints each name and price,
reduces their prices by $5.00, and then prints the prices again.

I also learnt about the printf() and String.format() methods. Implemented these while doing this exercise.
